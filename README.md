<hr>

Termux-MDS2.0 is a Upgraded version of Termux-MDS"Since Youtube-dl really slow know Termux-MDS2.0 is still downloading things but really slow and Termux-MDS2.0 overcomes that problem. I have added all the previous features of Termux-MDS2.0 as well as added youtube shorts support. So now while watching shorts you can just share any shorts with termux and it will download it at a lightning speed.
